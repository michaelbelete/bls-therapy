# BLS Therapy

Bilateral Stimulation (BLS) simply means stimulation of both sides, as in both sides of the brain. In EMDR Therapy we use this method to assist the client in processing traumatic memories, and in processing fears or worries of future problems. BLS is used to activate or ‘awaken’ the whole brain, similar to the function of  ‘Rapid Eye Movement’ (REM) sleep patterns. Bilateral Stimulation is believed to facilitate the process of the re-filing of memories into a more efficient and useful place in the brain and body. There are basically two theories of why BLS, in particular left to right, or vertical to horizontal eye movements, is beneficial to the client’s ability to process disturbing memories. One is the ‘working memory’ theory, and the other is the idea that BLS increases ‘interhemispheric communication.


Everything you need to build a this project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
